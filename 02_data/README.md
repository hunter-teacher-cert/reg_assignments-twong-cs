# Data Analytics: Chipotle Edition
A few years ago, I signed up for a free workshop for General Assembly's Data Analytics Bootcamp. They provided a dataset from Chipotle and had us interpret the data in ways useful for a restaurant like Chipotle. I am turnkey-ing this into an activity for students.

## Materials & Prerequisite Knowledge
* Google Sheets dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgHi4chIIE-28BJEQhW7b3a25djg0t068pUkB8NaDPg/edit?usp=sharing
* Students should know about basic Google Sheets formulas and functions like addition, subtraction, SUM, sorting , and filtering.

## Lesson

### Do Now
Students will be asked in groups to examine the data on the first tab of the spreadsheet titled "2015 Properties". Using their knowledge of Google Sheets, they will answer the questions:

* How many total properties did Chipotle operate?
* How many Chipotle properties did Chipotle operate in the US?
* How many Chipotle properties did Chipotle operate outside the US?
* Which geography had the most Chipotle properties?
* Which geography had the least Chipotle properties?

### Activity
Working in the same groups, students will act as Chipotle's new marketing and sales teams. Using the provided data, students will
* analyze the trend of overall growth in Chipotle properties/locations
* analyze trends in sales of different food items at Chipotle

to provide a marketing or sales strategy that would benefit Chipotle. This could be recommending a new location for Chipotle, a marketing strategy of pairing two food items as a cheaper combo meal, discontinuing certain food items if their sales are not up to par, etc.

### Discussion
Student groups will take turns presenting their findings and their marketing recommendations.
