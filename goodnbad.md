# Teaching: Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs
* Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly.
  - Why do you think it didnâ€™t go well?
  - What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
* Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well.
  - Why do you think it went so well?
* These examples could come from normal classes, presentations, tutoring sessions, helping a friend, as long as you were teaching, it can count.

## The Bad
Is it possible to love teaching but not love teaching some concepts? My whole teaching career I have only known standardized test-based curricula. I have only taught Common Core Algebra I, which culminates in a Regents exam, and AP Computer Science Principles, which ends in a multiple-choice AP exam.

I therefore find myself in situations where I have to teach topics that I don't want to teach or have to teach in a way that I don't like. An example: a component of a student's final AP score for AP CSP is the Create Performance Task - a program accompanied by a written report that is graded by a binary eight-point rubric. See here: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-2021-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines.pdf.

The idea of the assignment is sound - students can demonstrate their programming skills and creativity. However, the rubric is controversial in assessing the quality of student programs and write-ups. For example, the rubric requires students to write an abstraction that includes both selection and iteration. While I understand wanting to assess students' knowledge of if-else statements and loops, requiring it in a custom function forces their hand into creating functions that can be better off without these structures. Students who completed their programs sometimes include an arbitrary loop in their function because, well, the Performance Task requires it.

It's difficult to say how to make it better. The mission statement of AP CSP is to broaden access to computer science - it's meant to be an introduction course. I'm wondering if the Internet unit is necessary at all? And if we can emphasize the social impact unit in place of it. After all, we are educating the next generation of digital citizens. As for the Performance Task, perhaps creating a more granular rubric that assesses if students has a conditional in their entire program code and, separately, if there is a loop somewhere else.

## The Good
While my students enjoy coding, any sort of unplugged activity is always well-received. It breaks up the monotony of always programming and allows students to think of computer science through a different perspective.

There are unplugged activities that I've written about before in Methods I class. One that I haven't written about belonged to a lesson about the history of computer science. As students came to class, I offered them either a white or green index card. On each card read a significant milestone in the development of computer science, like the creation of the Internet, or a commonly known event that was easy to make reference to, like when YouTube was born. The color of their index card determined which team they were on. The white and green teams then compete to build an accurate timeline of events. Students almost never get it right but the spirit of competitiveness and surprise when students realize many developments didn't happen when they expected to makes this activity a whole lot of fun.
