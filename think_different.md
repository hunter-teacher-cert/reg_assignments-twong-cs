# Differing Differentiation
* Describe 3 different strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
* Things to consider:
  - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
  - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
  - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
  - Anything else you deem important

## If There Is Time
Students who complete classwork early can complete the "If There Is Time" activities so they can remain engaged on the content. These activities should be optional to complete (maybe even be extra credit), an extension of the classwork, and related to the learning objectives. For example, if the learning objective is to understand how information is kept private on the Internet and the classwork is about encryption, the extension activity can be about different types of ciphers that students can explore. Allowing students opportunities to explore the content further

## Homogenous Grouping
When students are grouped based on similar skill level, I find that their discussions can be more productive and it doesn't allow the struggling students to hide behind others. In my experience, when the difference in abilities is too great, the imbalance creates an opportunity for the weaker student to stay quiet and allow the stronger student to do the bulk of the work. Furthermore, the stronger student is not always interested in catching the weaker students up and they also prefer to the most of the work because they don't have to go through the trouble of explaining what is going on.

When grouping students by skill level, the stronger groups/pairs can complete the "If There is Time" activities and remain engaged. The groups that are on pace can complete only the required parts of the classwork. If the classwork allows for different tasks to complete, the stronger groups can take on the harder tasks. For example, let's say the lesson is on identifying and resolving bugs in code that the class has been working on. The stronger groups can be given the trickier or harder bugs to resolve.

## Open-Ended Tasks
When students engage in open-ended assignments and there is not one correct answer that all students have to get to, students are less likely to get discouraged from completing the assignment or feeling like they can't do it. Coding and other forms of project-based learning are great in that there are many ways to solve the same problem. Students with different abilities will find their own ways to solve the same problem. Some solutions will be more sophisticated and others may not be, but all solutions are solutions that work and are correct.

This relates to open-ended questions too. For example, if the lesson is on the Internet and the question is "How can billions of devices find one other in order to communicate over the internet?," the following responses can be expected:

- (low-level) Every device on the Internet has an IP address so they can send and receive data.
- (mid-level) IP addressing is hierarchical; making it easy to route information from source to destination.
- (high-level) IP governs the routing of data on the Internet and routers pass info from one network to another; the end-to-end architecture of the Internet and the hierarchical nature of IP and DNS make the Internet scalable and fault tolerant.

Based on what students know, their responses will vary and these are all correct answers. Since some responses are better than others in communicating their knowledge of the Internet, a discussion can follow on why the high-level response is better than the others.
