# Grading Schema for list_lab
* Look at the python lab files here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/tree/main/resources
* Pick a lab, and create a grading schema for it. Assume you can assign any kind of grade you want.

## Assignment
I've chosen the list_lab.py assignment. Please see in the resources folder of this repo for the starter code and possible solutions.

## Rubric
As I do with labs in my class, I would grade this for completion and a couple of specific exercises for accuracy. Out of 10 points, a student would score 1 point each for attempting every problem (there are 8 exercises total) and 1 point each for accuracy and completeness for 2 exercises. The two exercises that I'm grading for accuracy depend on the objectives of the lesson. If it is important for students to manipulate list functions and draw bar graphs, then I would grade Problems 5 and 6.

Attempting each question: __/8 (1 pt each problem)
Solving Problem 5:        __/1
Solving Problem 6:        __/1
                         -----
                         __/10
