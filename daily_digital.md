## Article & Motivation
I read "How Native Americans Are Trying to Debug A.I.â€™s Biases" from the NYTimes (2022): https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/technology/ai-data-indigenous-ivow.html?utm_content=ig-nytimes. Computer vision is teaching computers how to see and interpret what the image is. To teach a computer to recognize a dog, it'll show it a lot of different examples of dogs so that the computer can start to recognize what dogs can look like. The problem is algorithms are only as good as the data its provided. Algorithmic bias exists because most of the training data set did not include enough culturally responsive input data. Therefore, potentially offensive and culturally insensitive misidentifications can result. For example, the computer was not taught to recognize a Native American wearing ceremonial regalia, so it incorrectly identified the person as a bird. Efforts are being made to rectify such bias, like a start-up named "Intelligent Voices of Wisdom." IVOW wants to create "cultural engines" to more accurately represent different cultures.

I selected this story because I want to highlight underrepresented groups and cultures in AI. To eliminate algorithmic sampling bias, we must do better and represent all cultures when training AI. This bias exists not only against indigenous people, but among various minority groups and cultures that are not well-known. I am hoping to bring more awareness to this topic to students.
