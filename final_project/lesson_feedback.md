# Lesson Feedback

## What Went Well
* Do Now was relevant to students' personal interests and engaging
* Clear instructions on what students are doing
* Lesson activity was aligned with learning objectives
* Differentiation - starter code & open-ended programming assignment

## What Could've Gone Better
* Better pacing/timing of lesson & activity
* More reinforcement of new vocabulary
* Student facing handout to more clearly outline instructions for the program they're making
* Better utilizing wait time to encourage participation

## Improvements
Including a written component alongside the program or assessing students' knowledge of the new vocabulary in the Exit Ticket are two ways to better reinforce new vocab terms.

Instead of calling on students, I wish I gave them time to talk more about different parts of the lab or created more opportunities for students to work together, maybe even pair program. The lack of student voice made it hard to assess what students needed support with. I could have had one student share their screen and others build on their program as navigators to encourage collaboration.
